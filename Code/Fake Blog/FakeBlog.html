    <H>Free tha Creator</H>

    <p>Freeing the creator is like an ecstacy. The walls of cognitive dissonance falling like Jericho before my eye. It is a slice of Nirvana that is infinitely divisible and visibly tangible yet escapes the human perception. I welcome the day where we relinquish the ownerhsip of identity and allow all to be.</p>
    <ul>The process is simple and comes in threes
        <li> Know thyself</li>
        <li>Love thyself</li>
        <li>Become the Creator</li>

    </ul>
